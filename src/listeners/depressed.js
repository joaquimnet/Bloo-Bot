Reach out to a good friend or family member and hang out with them. \nTalking to them, if you trust them, is a great alternative to coping with your emotions. \nSome other good coping mechanisms can include: listening to music(your favorite, of course), writing, drawing, going for a walk, playing video games, or even a good nap. Anything you enjoy can help relieve such. \nEven when you feel apathetic or anhedonic, I promise that trying to do such will trigger the serotonin in your brain, and make you feel relieve/happier',
